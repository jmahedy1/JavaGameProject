A partner and I created a RPG (Role play Game) with a basic GUI. You are an adventurer and you goal is to get strong enough to slay the final boss.
You can train various stats, go on different difficulty quests, and purchase weapons and armor upgrades. You have one month to prepare before you have to 
fight the boss. Good luck!
